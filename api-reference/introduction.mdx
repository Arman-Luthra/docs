## Overview

The Skop API enables intelligent document extraction from websites using natural language prompts. All requests are made to `https://api.skop.dev` and require authentication.

**Base URL:** `https://api.skop.dev`

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using Bearer tokens in the Authorization header:

```javascript
const headers = {
  'Authorization': 'Bearer sk-your-api-key-here',
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}
```

### API Key Formats

Skop supports the following API key formats:
- `sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxx` (recommended)
- `sk_xxxxxxxxxxxxx` (also supported)

## How it works

The Skop API follows an asynchronous job-based workflow:

1. **Create a job** - Submit a website URL and natural language prompt
2. **Monitor progress** - Poll the status endpoint to track job progress  
3. **Retrieve results** - Get extracted documents when the job completes

## Rate Limits

API endpoints have the following rate limits:

| Endpoint | Limit |
|----------|-------|
| General endpoints | 100 requests/hour |
| Health check | 300 requests/hour |
| Status check | 200 requests/hour |

Rate limit information is returned in response headers:
- `X-Rate-Limit-Remaining` - Requests remaining in current window
- `X-Rate-Limit-Reset` - Unix timestamp when rate limit resets

## Error Responses

All endpoints return errors in a consistent format:

```json
{
  "error": true,
  "message": "Invalid API key",
  "status_code": 401,
  "path": "/scrape/",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-24T20:50:00Z"
}
```

### Common Error Codes

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `400` | Bad Request - Invalid parameters |
| `401` | Unauthorized - Invalid/missing API key |
| `402` | Payment Required - Insufficient credits |
| `403` | Forbidden - Insufficient permissions |
| `404` | Not Found - Job/resource not found |
| `429` | Too Many Requests - Rate limit exceeded |
| `500` | Internal Server Error |

## Job Status Values

Jobs progress through the following statuses:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `pending` | Job queued, waiting to start |
| `in_progress` | Job is currently running |
| `completed` | Job finished successfully |
| `failed` | Job encountered an error |
| `cancelled` | Job was cancelled by user |

## Billing

Billing is based on successful page scraping:

- **Single page jobs**: $0.18 per page with results
- **Multi-page jobs**: $0.25 per page with results
- No charge for pages without relevant documents
- Credits are deducted in real-time during job execution

## TypeScript Support

The API includes TypeScript definitions for all request and response types:

```typescript
interface ScrapeRequest {
  website: string
  prompt: string
  parameters?: ScrapeParameters
}

interface ScrapeParameters {
  single_page?: boolean
  timeout?: number
  confidence_threshold?: number
  file_type?: 'document'
  max_file_size_mb?: number
}

type JobStatus = 'pending' | 'in_progress' | 'completed' | 'failed' | 'cancelled'
```
